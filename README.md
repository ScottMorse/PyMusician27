## PyMusician for Python 2.7

### `$ pip install pymusician27`
This is actually a separate package from PyMusician, but all functionality is the same as PyMusician version 1.1.2.  

I ported this code over for personal use with some applications that have Python shells in only 2.7, but PyMusician's focus will be on 3.6 and beyond.
